ECE 110: Introduction to Circuits Integrated Design Challenge


This holds the weekly schedule, updates, gantt chart, and the final report of this semester long process.

ABSTRACT:

The Integrated Design Challenge is comprised of several tasks that needed to be completed by each individual bot within the lab section. Each bot’s task requires the utilization of line following, communication, and different sensing capabilities. Successful sensing of the bot’s objects and communication between bots would result in the accurate calculation and display of the score acquired between the bot pair and the lab section according to the set up of objects in the IDC arena. Throughout the IDC, several different sensors were used to complete the tasks given to each bot. Three QTI sensors placed at the bottom of each bot were used for line following. For communication between bots, an XBee module was used. The specific sensing technique differed between bots depending on the object it was given to sense. For Chaser Bot 2, the sensing task assigned was to detect the number of large, red quaffles placed at each hash along its line. A whisker wire was used to sense these quaffles. During the final demonstration, all five trials were perfectly executed. The individual bot, Chaser-Beater pair, and final team scores were all displayed accurately on their own LCD display after each bot perfectly sensed their objects.
